# Burger-App

In this assignment, I am creating Burger-App designed MVC pattern way. 
User will be provided with input field to type burger that he wants to order.
After user submitted, it will added to burger list, which have not been devoured yet.
Once they choose to "devour" their burger, the page refreshes and the burger is logged in the column that displays all of the devoured burgers.
